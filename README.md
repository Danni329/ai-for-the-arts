## AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio
**GUID：2750864**
- This repository documents my learning journey through the "Artificial Intelligence for the Arts & Humanities" course. It includes exploratory coding exercises, interactive experiments, machine learning reflections, and a final creative design project that integrates large language models into cultural heritage engagement.
- **Highlights**
1. Python Foundations with Copilot

Used GitHub Codespaces and Copilot to write beginner-friendly Python code.

Explored core concepts: variables, functions, loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, and best practices.

Learned to prompt Copilot effectively for better coding support.

2. Data, Media & Visualization

Embedded YouTube videos and audio files using IPython.display.

Displayed and transformed images using matplotlib.

Reflected on media as data and experimented with its visualization and manipulation.

3. Machine Learning Workflow

Explored the full ML pipeline: framing problems, preparing data, training models, and testing results.

Worked with tabular housing data and image-based digit classification using TensorFlow and CNNs.

Used the TensorFlow Playground to understand neural networks interactively.

Reflected on dataset bias, curation, and AI ethics in real-world applications.

4. Creative LLM Design Project

A human-AI interactive design that empowers unexhibited museum artifacts to 'speak' via LLMs. Visitors can explore a virtual museum storage room, interact with AI-powered artifact narrators, and ask natural-language questions to learn about hidden histories. The project promotes inclusive access to cultural memory and reflects on the ethical and educational value of AI in heritage dissemination.

### Purpose & Learning Goals
1. Practice Python programming with the help of Microsoft Copilot.
2. Develop a practical understanding of key machine learning concepts
3. Explore how large language models (LLMs) can be creatively applied in the arts and humanities.
4. Reflect critically on AI’s societal impact and ethical implications in cultural contexts.
