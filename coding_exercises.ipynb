    "I explored all programming concepts in Python and presented several core concepts. Using Copilot as a learning assistant helped me not just generate code, but also begin to understand the underlying logic and structure of Python programs. It provided instant examples that I could run and study, which was especially useful as a complete beginner. Copilot’s suggested follow-up prompts pushed me to explore deeper questions I hadn’t thought to ask on my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, I started to see how code is structured, how logic flows, and how different elements (like functions, loops, and data structures) come together to build programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### limitations\n",
    " Sometimes Copilot’s answers were too brief or assumed background knowledge I didn’t have. I had to ask more specific follow-ups to get the full picture. I realized that it’s not enough to copy what Copilot gives. I learned the most when I test the code, find something doesn’t work, and then figure out why.  \n"
